I hope to add more to it as I think up new ideas!\n\n# Introduction\nThe San Francisco crime dataset provides a special opportunity to play with data visually. \nAs a hobbyist photographer, I am a big fan of pretty pictures.\nSince the dataset covers a wide variety of crimes, visualizing them all at once might wash out any patterns \ncontained in smaller subgroups. I have elected to see if there are any patterns within violent crime that \ncan be explored visually.\n\n# The Data\nColumns include logitude and latitude, the category the crime is classified as,  \nand date and time. When we import the data, we extract the Year, Month, Day, and Hour as individual \ncolumns. This will allow us to break out our visualizations more easily into these dimensions.\n\nLets look at all the crime categories to see which might fall under the umbrella of 'Violent Crime'\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\ncoltypes <-\n    list(Dates = col_datetime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\ntrain <-\n    read_csv(file=\"../input/train.csv\",\n                  col_types=coltypes)\ntest <-\n    read_csv(file=\"../input/test.csv\",\n                  col_types=coltypes) \n\ntrain <-\n    train %>%\n    mutate(Year  = factor(year(Dates), levels=2003:2015),\n           Month = factor(month(Dates), levels=1:12),\n           Day   = day(Dates),\n           Hour  = factor(hour(Dates), levels=0:23),\n           dayDate = as.POSIXct(round(Dates, units = \"days\")),\n           DayOfWeek = factor(DayOfWeek, levels=c(\"Monday\",\n                                                  \"Tuesday\",\n                                                  \"Wednesday\",\n                                                  \"Thursday\",\n                                                  \"Friday\",\n                                                  \"Saturday\",\n                                                  \"Sunday\"))\n           )\n           \nunique(train$Category)\n```\n### Observation\nThe categories that seem to fit the 'Violent Crime' umbrella seem to be 'Assault', 'Robbery', and\n'Sex Offences Forcible'. Lets grab those columns.\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nmapdata <-\n    train %>%\n    filter(Category %in% c(\"ASSAULT\", \"ROBBERY\", \"SEX OFFENSES FORCIBLE\"))\n\nmapdata %>%\ngroup_by(Category) %>%\nsummarise(n=n())\n```\n### Observation\nOccurences of assault far outnumber the other crimes, and as such will be heavily represented in any\naggregate observations. It will be interesting to look at violent crime both in aggregate and by \nspecific category.\n\n# Mapping\nLet's build our first map. We will use the map provided by Kaggle, as well as the ggmap package. \nLets being with an obvious first map, one with a point for each crime in the dataset.\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nmap <- \n    readRDS(\"../input/sf_map_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.rds\")\n\nggmap(map, extent='device', legend=\"topleft\") +\ngeom_point(aes(x=X, y=Y, colour=Category), data=mapdata ) +  \nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n```\n\n### Observation\nThis is not a particularly useful map. The colors all overlap and obscure one another. \nNo patterns are readily visible. The small gaps that interupt the otherwise uniform coverage of the map\nseem to correspond to parks and bodies of water, and so is not that unusual. Lets see if\nmapping by category will be more revealing.\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nggmap(map, extent='device') +\ngeom_point(aes(x=X, y=Y, colour=Category), data=mapdata ) +\nscale_colour_discrete(guide='none') +\nfacet_wrap(~Category) +\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n\n```\n\n### Observation\nEven when broken out by category the maps aren't particularly revealing. The map coverage is lower for \nsex offences, but that is likely due to the overall fewer crimes of that category commiitted. \nMaybe a different type of map would be more informative.\n\nLets try a contour plot. We will estimate the density of crimes from our longitude and latitudes \nand use that to plot contours. This should more easily reveal patterns and hotspots for violent crime.\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncontours <- stat_density2d(\naes(x = X, y = Y, fill = ..level.., alpha=..level..),\nsize = 0.1, data = mapdata, n=200,\ngeom = \"polygon\")\n\nggmap(map, extent='device', legend=\"topleft\") + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity')+\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n```\n\n### Observation\nThis map seems much more informative. It reveals a giant hotspot in the Tenderloin neighborhood, with lots of smaller\nhotspots in the surrounding neighborhoods. Additionally, there are spots in the south-east in the Hunter's Point \narea and one all the way south in the Vistacion neighborhood. \n\nLets pull the map in to focus on these areas. Additionally, lets look at maps by specific category of crime.\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nlims <- coord_map(xlim=c(-122.47, -122.37), ylim=c(37.70, 37.81))\n\nggmap(map, extent='device', legend=\"topleft\") + lims + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity')+\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Category) +\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n```\n\n### Observation\nThe overall structure of the contours seem to be about the same as the aggregate, with the largest hotspot \ncentered in the Tenderloin neighborhood area. With Assault and Robbery, these occurences seem to be much more \nconcentrated, while Sex Offences seems to cover a larger area. Additionally, a hotspot for Sex Offences appears\nin the Outer Mission neighborhood where the others do not have a hotspot. The lower overall density of sex \noffences compared to the other categrories of crime is expected, as there are simply fewer crimes of this \ncategory in the data.\n\nNow lets see if any interesting patterns emerge if we start looking at the information temporally. \nLets start with crime by Day of Week.\n\n(Note: I could have created the plots broken out by Category and Day of Week by using \n'facet_wrap(~Category+DayOfWeek)'. However that command producem plots too samll to be appreciably viewed. \nAs such, I broke out the mapping commands for each category separately. Also note that for the bar plots I use the\noption scales='free'. While this means that it will be more difficult to use the bar graphs to make absolute\ncomparisons between the categories, it will allow easier observation of the structure within each category.)\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncontoursALT <- stat_density2d(\naes(x = X, y = Y, fill = ..level.., alpha=..level..),\nsize = 0.1, data = filter(mapdata, Category=='ASSAULT'), n=200,\ngeom = \"polygon\")\n\ncontoursROB <- stat_density2d(\naes(x = X, y = Y, fill = ..level.., alpha=..level..),\nsize = 0.1, data = filter(mapdata, Category=='ROBBERY'), n=200,\ngeom = \"polygon\")\n\ncontoursSOF <- stat_density2d(\naes(x = X, y = Y, fill = ..level.., alpha=..level..),\nsize = 0.1, data = filter(mapdata, Category=='SEX OFFENSES FORCIBLE'), n=200,\ngeom = \"polygon\")\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek) +\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursALT +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek) +\nggtitle('Assaults in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursROB +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek) +\nggtitle('Robberies in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursSOF +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek) +\nggtitle('Sex Offences Forcible in San Francisco')\n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=DayOfWeek)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') \n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=DayOfWeek)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') +\nfacet_wrap(~Category, scales='free')\n\n```\n\n### Observation\nWhen looking at violent crime in aggregate, volume seems to be fairly constant, with only a slight bump up on the\nweekend. Whats interesting to note is that the crimes seem more concentrated to a central Tenderloin area on \nTuesday, Saturday, and Sunday. The maps on these days exihbit less spread despite crime volume fairly similar to \nother days of the week, as shown in the bar plot. \n\nWhen looking at violent crime by catgory, we see smilar patterns\nin crime volume. Assaults and Sex Offences have slight peaks on the weekend, while robbery seems to peak on Friday\nand Saturday. The contours also change very little day over day. Interstingly, the more concentrated and less \ndiffuse contours that are seen in aggregate on \nTuesday, Saturday, and Sunday are not (or are less obviously) visible when looking at the contours for\neach category (more investigation needed to find out why, maybe.)\n\nNow lets look by hour.\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Hour) +\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursALT +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Hour) +\nggtitle('Assaults in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursROB +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Hour) +\nggtitle('Robberies in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursSOF +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Hour) +\nggtitle('Sex Offences Forcible in San Francisco')\n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=Hour)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') \n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=Hour)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') +\nfacet_wrap(~Category, scales='free')\n\n```\n\n### Observation\nWhen looking in aggregate, there is a logical a dip in the sleepy, early morning twilight hours between 3am and 6am. \nIt then picks up and holds steady starting around 3pm, before increasing one last time around midnight. The countour\nplots don't seem to reveal any large particular variation.\n\nLooking by category reveals some intersting patterns. The dip in robbery occurs later than for the other crimes,\nbetween 5am and 7am. Robbery dips beteen 3am and 5am and sex offences dips between 3am and 6am. Additionally,\nrobbery peaks around 10pm, two hours earier than the other categories. Also interesting to note is that the \nrelative peak for sex offences is much larger for sex offences is much larger than the peaks for the other\ncategories, with the peak for sex offences about twice as high as the next largest value. Looking at the contours,\nassault does not show any obvious patterns. Between 1 am and 4am, robbery is much more concentrated in the Tenderloin\nneighborhood. Between 1am and 3am, sx offences is similarly concentrated, but it is also highly diffuse in comparison \nto the other categories.\n\nSince we have noticed patterns late at night, it will be interesting to incorporate\nday of week information into these plots, as people are more likely to be awake at these hours on the weekend.\nLets look at some barplots that do that.\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=Hour)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') + \nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek)\n\nggplot(data=filter(mapdata, Category=='ASSAULT'), aes(x=Hour)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count of Assault') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek, scales='free')\n\nggplot(data=filter(mapdata, Category=='ROBBERY'), aes(x=Hour)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count of Robbery') +\nfacet_wrap(~DayOfWeek, scales='free')\n\n#ggplot(data=filter(mapdata, Category=='SEX OFFENCES FORCIBLE', aes(x=Hour)) +\n#geom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\n#ylab('Count of Sex Offences') +\n#facet_wrap(~DayOfWeek, scales='free')\n```\n\n### Observation\nIn aggregate, violent crime peaks late at night only on the weekend. When looking by category, Assault shows the\nsame pattern. During the week, Robbery peaks earier, around 10pm, and on the weekends robbery peaks around 2am.\nSex offenses continues to show a very strong midnight peak every day of the week. I wonder what that effect could\nbe attributed to.\n\nNow lets look by month\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contours +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Month) +\nggtitle('Violent Crime in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursALT +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Month) +\nggtitle('Assaults in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursROB +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Month) +\nggtitle('Robberies in San Francisco')\n\nggmap(map, extent='device') + lims + contoursSOF +\nscale_alpha_continuous(range=c(0.25,0.4), guide='none') +\nscale_fill_gradient('Violent\\nCrime\\nDensity') +\nfacet_wrap(~Month) +\nggtitle('Sex Offences Forcible in San Francisco')\n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=Month)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') \n\nggplot(data=mapdata, aes(x=Month)) +\ngeom_bar(colour=\"black\", fill=\"skyblue\") +\nylab('Count') +\nfacet_wrap(~Category, scales='free')\n\n```\n\n### Observation\nThe barplots reveal a small cylical pattern where there are peaks in the Spring and Fall, and dips in the Summer \nand Winter. It seems that more extreme weather has a small effect at reducing violent crime. This is seen in the\nplot in aggregate, and in the plots by category. The contour plots don't really show any patterns except for sex\noffences, which shows much more concentrated contours in February and July.\n\n\n#Summary\nJust a very high level recap of what has been learned.\n\n-- Contour Plots work better than plotting the points themselves for this data.\n-- Violent crime seems to be concentrated aroud Tenderloin, with more distant spots in the Hunter's Point, \nVistacion, and Outer Mission Area.\n-- Sex Offences seems to be concentrated more diffusely about these hotspots compared to the other two.\n-- Violent crime is down early in the morning, up on the weekends, and down during the Summer and Winter.\n-- Robbery peaks slightly earlier than the rest of violent crime during the week.\n-- Assault is by far the most common violent crime.\n\n# Final Note\nMany of the things discussed here might seem fairly obvious. \n'Of course there will be less violent crime at those hours; everyone is asleep!' or 'Of course there is less \nviolent crime in the Summer and Winter, everyone wants to stay indoors!' Because those things are so obvious, \nit is a good thing that we see those effects! If we didn't, it might indicate errors in the data. More \nexcitingly, it could also reveal a truly unique effect in the data. I feel its good\npractice to make sure any obvious expectations are also evident in the data, as it is an easy way to improve\nthe quality of the analysis.\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n```\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"26fad5c9-3308-474a-82c8-6504a76987e1","_cell_guid":"10bdd6d7-4a1b-4bd3-8dbc-30dc6d27080e","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
